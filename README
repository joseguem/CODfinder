For running CODfinder.R from the terminal:

1. Open R from the terminal.
2. source("CODfinder.R")
3. codfinder(inputfile="path/to/input",window.size=,outfile="path/to/output")

inputfile: 
Expression matrix where each column is a gene (in chromosome order) and each row is the numeric value of expression for each sample for all genes in the chromosome. 
Include a header with gene names
CODfinder.R uses tab delimited .txt format (sep="\t") as inputfile, in case your expression matrix is written in a different format, change line 19 in "sep=".

Window.size:
Use 4 for window.size as default.

Outfile:
The standard output include:
-correlation file (*.correl.csv): (n+1)*(n+1) matrix, where n is the number of genes. Extra row and column with gene names.
-binsignal file (*.binsignal.csv): includes the value of binsignal (mean.cf) as defined in TOPDOM, and p-value for each bin.
-COD file (*.COD.csv): list of CODs detected after filtering. For each COD start and end coordinates (in gene number) are listed.

Output files are written in .csv as default. If you want it in a different format see lines 174, 178 and 182.
If you don't need correlation or binsignal file, add ## to lines 175 and/or 179 respectively.

Correlation file can be open directly in Gitools (version 2.3.0)
